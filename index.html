       <p>Hey my name is feysal omar </p>
       
       <p> Im 19 years old but besides my age I have a lot of work experience.</p>
       
       <p> At age 16-17 I would volunteer at the seattle public library to help bring communty kids together though group programs.</p>
       
       <p>Then going on to 17 I got my first grown up job at the seattle seahawks stadium working front desk at the pro shop so I think I could say I have experience in  retail and customer support.</p>
           
      <p> After highschool I decided to get my guard license and become a part time security guard at the starbucks headquarter, I did that for a year and decided to quit to pursue my career as an emerging professional studying at seattle central campus to earn a certificate in software development.</p>
